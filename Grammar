## 定语从句

·定语从句的关系词：关系词指引导定语从句的关联词，包括关系代词和关系副词。
a)that指物，有时也可以指人；which指物，不能指人。

 只用that不用which的情况：
①先行词指物且含有不定代词(all, little, few, much, everything, anything等)，先行词前有next，last，very，any，little，no等修饰时
* Do you have anything that you want to say for yourself?
* All that Lily told me seems untrue.
②先行词被the only, the very, the right, any, every, some, no, just等修饰
* This is the very bus that I am waiting for.
* The only thing that we can do is to lend you some money.
③先行词含有最高级或含有序数词时，如：
* This train is the last that will go to Suzhou.
* This is the first two-story bus that runs in our city.
* What is the most interesting film that you have ever seen?
④先行词既有人又有物
* Do you know the things and persons that they are talking about?
⑤避免重复
a. 主句的主语是疑问词who或which
* Which is the bike that you have lost?
* Who is the boy that won the gold medal?
b. 两个定语从句，其中一个用which另一个用that
* They secretly built up a small factory, which produced things that could cause much pollution.
c. 先行词在主句中作表语,关系词在从句中也作表语
* Shanghai is no longer the city that it used to be.
⑥ 主句是there be 句型且关系词在从句中作主语
* There is a seat that is still available.



## the most和most的详细区别是什么？

区别如下：
1. 若所修饰的名词前没有限定词，通常要用most，不用most of。
例：Most people agree with me. 多数人同意我的意见。
例：Most people work from nine to five. 大多数人从9点工作到5点。
2. 在习惯上不带冠词的专有名词（如人名和地名等）或抽象名词（如学科名词等）前，要用most of，不用most。
例：Most of George seemed to be covered with hair. 乔治身上好像大部分地方都长毛。
3. 若所修饰的名词前带有限定词，则用most of，不能只用most。
例：Most of my friends live abroad. 我的朋友大多数住在国外。
例：Most of the people here know each other. 这里大多数人互相认识。
4. 若直接用在代词之前，要用most of，不用most。
例：Most of us thought he was wrong. 我们大多数人认为他错了。
例：Most of them probably eat too much meat. 他们大多数人都吃太多的肉了
5. 对于可数名词来说，如果是单数形式，不能直接在其前使用most，而应使用“most of+限定词+单数可数名词”的形式。
例：Narrative makes up most of the book. 记叙文占书的大部分。
例：You’ve got most of the bed as usual. 你跟往常一样占了大半张床。
